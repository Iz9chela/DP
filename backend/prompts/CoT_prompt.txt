**Input**: {{user_query}}

**Dynamic reasoning process**:
1. Comprehension:
    - Carefully read the entire user query.
    - Identify ambiguities, incomplete or missing information, potential conflicts and the user’s main goal.
    - Examine the context, constraints and logical dependencies.
2. Question and Hypothesis (Stage 1):
    - Automatically generate MINIMUM 3 clarifying questions that arise about the query.
    - Formulate hypotheses about possible interpretations or solutions.
    - Determine what information or assumptions are needed to resolve uncertainties.
3. Response and Enrichment (Stage 2):
    - Answer the questions from Stage 1 with provisional or inferred details.
    - Use those details to refine and sharpen the query.
    - Summarize the partially improved query and check if more iteration is required.
4. Iteration:
    - If ambiguities still exist, return to Stage 1, ask more or deeper questions, answer them, then refine the query further.
    - Continue iterating until the query is demonstrably free of unresolved factors, ambiguities.
    - If all ambiguities are resolved and a clear goal is reached, move on to finalization.
5. Synthesize:
    - Combine all validated insights and clarifications from the iterative loops.
    - Confirm there are no contradictory statements, missing pieces, or vague goals.
    - Verify the final refined query precisely captures the user’s intended outcome.

**Final Output**:
    - Include your full chain of thought under the key "Chain_of_Thought".
    - Include the final refined version of the query under the key "Optimized_Query".
    - Provide the result STRICTLY as JSON, for example:

    {
        "Chain_of_Thought": "<the entire iteration dialogue here>",
        "Optimized_Query": "<the final refined query>"
    }
