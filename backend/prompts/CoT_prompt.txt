**Input**: {{user_query}}

**Step-by-step reasoning process**:
1. Comprehension:
    - Read the entire query carefully, identifying possible ambiguities or incomplete information.
2. Analyze:
	- Identify the main goal and key components of the query.
	- Understand the context and constraints of the query.
	- Analyze the logical dependencies and required steps.
3. Decompose:
    - Break down the query into sequential logical steps.
    - Analyze each step independently.
    - When encountering ambiguous segments, propose reasonable assumptions or clarifications based on the available context.
    - Ask yourself clarifying questions about any complexities or unclear points.
4. Elaborate:
    - Provide detailed, intermediate reasoning for each step.
    - Expand on the implications, constraints and logical dependencies that come up.
    - Incorporate any clarifications required by ambiguities.
5. Synthesize:
    - Combine the detailed steps into a coherent, enhanced version of the query.
    - Verify that the query reflects the original goal with improved precision.

**Final Output**:
    - Include your full chain of thought under the key "Chain_of_Thought".
    - Include the final refined version of the query under the key "Optimized_Query".
    - Provide the result STRICTLY as JSON, for example:

    {
        "Chain_of_Thought": "<the entire step-by-step analysis>",
        "Optimized_Query": "<the final refined query>"
    }
