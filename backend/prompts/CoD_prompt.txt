**Input**: {{user_query}}

**Instructions**:
You will generate a series of concise, context-aware and entity-dense optimized versions of the input query over {{number_of_iterations}} iterations.
Explicitly pass context forward by summarizing and incorporating improvements iteratively.

Step 1: Initial Analysis
    - Comprehensively analyze the initial query.
    - Identify clearly aspects such as clarity, precision, relevance, and entity-density that could benefit from improvement.
    - Summarize explicitly your analysis as context for the next step.

**Iterative Process** (Repeat for each iteration):
Step 2: Identify Improvement Opportunities
    - Extract 1–3 concise improvement points (separated by ";") that address aspects such as clarity, entity density,
     precision, or relevance missing from the previous version.
    - An improvement point should be:
        • Relevant to the core subject.
        • Specific and concise (5 words or fewer).
        • Be novel compared to the previous iteration.
        • Preserve accuracy and remain faithful to the original intent.
        • Integrated at any suitable point in the text.

Step 3: Create a Denser, Optimized Query
    - Rewrite explicitly the query preserving essential context and incorporating all improvements from the current iteration.
    - Maintain or slightly adjust word count:
        • Minimal expansion allowed only if critical details must be preserved.
        • Avoid dropping critical context, even if it means minor increases in length.
        • Otherwise, aim explicitly for conciseness by removing redundancy.
    - Explicitly summarize your optimized query clearly as context for the next iteration.

**Guidelines**:
    - The first iteration explicitly starts moderately verbose to highlight improvement opportunities.
    - Each subsequent iteration should add novel improvements, it must not conflict with the original intent or lose critical information.
    - Preserve critical information explicitly, allowing minimal expansion if necessary.

**Output Format**:
    - Your response must STRICTLY adhere to JSON format provided below. No additional explanations or text outside the JSON structure are permitted.
    - Provide a STRICTLY JSON of {{number_of_iterations}} objects:
