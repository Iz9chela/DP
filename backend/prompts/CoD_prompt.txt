**Input**: {{user_query}}

**Instructions**:
You will generate a series concise and entity-dense optimized versions of the input query over {{number_of_iterations}} iterations.
Perform the following 2 steps in each iteration:

Step 1: Identify Improvement Opportunities
    - Extract 1–3 concise improvement points (separated by ";") that address aspects such as clarity, precision, or relevance missing from the previous version.
    - An improvement point should be:
        • Relevant to the core subject.
        • Specific and concise (5 words or fewer).
        • Novel (not present in the previous version).
        • Accurate and faithful to the original input.
        • Integrated at any suitable point in the text.

Step 2: Create a Denser, Optimized Query
    - Rewrite the query, closely preserving or slightly expanding its word count:
        • If genuinely important details must be added, minimal expansion of the overall word count is allowed.
        • Otherwise, aim to maintain or even reduce word count by removing redundant text.
    - Incorporate every essential detail from the earlier version plus the identified improvements.
    - Avoid dropping critical context, even if it means minor increases in length.

**Guidelines**:
    - The first version may be moderately verbose, exposing potential areas for improvement.
    - With each iteration, remove redundancies and streamline language, prioritizing clarity and precision.
    - Each iteration should add novel improvements, it must not conflict with the original intent or lose critical information.
    - If space constraints interfere with preserving important content, expand slightly rather than omitting key points.

**Output Format**:
 - Provide a STRICTLY JSON list of {{number_of_iterations}} objects.
    - Each object must have:
      {
         "Improvement_Opportunities": "improvement1; improvement2; ...",
         "Optimized_Query": "..."
      }
    - The "Optimized_Query" can be the same length or slightly longer/shorter than the previous version, depending on the needed changes.
