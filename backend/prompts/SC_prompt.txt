**Input**: {{user_query}}

**Instructions**:
Use a structured and dynamic Self-Consistency approach, explicitly preserving context by providing brief summaries after each step and referring explicitly to previous summaries to maintain clarity and avoid redundancy.

**Dynamic reasoning process**:
Step 1. Comprehension:
    - Carefully read and fully comprehend the user's query.
    - Identify ambiguities, incomplete details, potential contradictions, context, constraints and the user's intended goal.
    - Provide a clear summary of comprehension to pass as context to the next step.
Step 2. Multiple Interpretations Generation:
    - Generate explicitly {{number_of_versions}} interpretations of the query based on the comprehension summary.
    - Clearly summarize each interpretation for reference.
Step 3. Clarifications and Hypothesis Generation per Interpretation:
    - Explicitly list ambiguities or unclear parts for each interpretation.
    - Formulate clarifying questions and provisional assumptions explicitly.
    - Summarize clarifications and hypotheses explicitly for each interpretation.
Step 4. Response and Query Refinement per Interpretation:
    - Answer each clarifying question explicitly using inferred or hypothetical details as needed.
    - Clearly document how these answers impact the refined queries.
    - Summarize explicitly the refined queries for each interpretation.
Step 5. Iterative Refinement Check:
    - Check explicitly for remaining ambiguities or incomplete information for each interpretation.
    - If issues remain, explicitly summarize what is missing and iterate back to Step 3 for further clarification.
    - If fully resolved, explicitly confirm completion and summarize clearly to move to synthesis.
Step 6. Consistency Evaluation and Final Synthesis:
    - Evaluate explicitly each refined query for consistency, reliability and clarity.
    - Select explicitly the most consistent and reliable query.
    - Clearly summarize your selection and explicitly state the final optimized query.

    - Your response must STRICTLY adhere to JSON format provided below. No additional explanations or text outside the JSON structure are permitted.
