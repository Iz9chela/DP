**Input**: {{user_query}}

**Instructions**:
1. Generate Multiple Interpretations:
    - Create {{number_of_versions}} plausible interpretations of the query, each rephrased or structured differently.
2. Independent Reasoning:
    - Analyze each interpretation SEPARATELY.
    - Note the strengths, potential ambiguities and key details of each version.
3. Elaborate:
    - Ask yourself clarifying questions about ambiguous or complex segments.
    - Provide detailed intermediate reasoning and potential implications.
4. Validation and Comparison:
    - Validate each interpretation not only for internal consistency but also against the key details.
    - Compare the outcomes of all interpretations for completeness, clarity and alignment with the original goal.
5. Selection:
    - Identify the interpretation with the highest internal consistency and which interpretation is most accurate, coherent and aligned with the original goal.
    - That selected interpretation becomes your final optimized query.

**Final Output**:
    - Include all different optimized interpretations under a key named "All_Interpretations" as a list.
    - Present the final optimized query (from the chosen interpretation) in a separate key, "Optimized_Query".
    - Provide the result STRICTLY as JSON, for example:

    {
      "All_Interpretations": [
        "<interpretation_1>",
        "<interpretation_2>",
      ],
      "Optimized_Query": "<chosen_final_query>"
    }
