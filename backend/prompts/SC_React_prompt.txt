Input: {{user_query}}

Instructions:
Use a structured and dynamic approach combining Self-Consistency (SC) and Reasoning+Action+Observation (ReAct).
You will explicitly generate {{number_of_iterations}} interpretations of the query, performing iterative cycles of reasoning, action, and observation for each interpretation.
Maintain clear context explicitly through summarization after each step.

**Dynamic Iterative Process per Interpretation**:
Step 1. Comprehension and Interpretation Generation:
    - Carefully read and fully comprehend the user's query.
    - Identify ambiguities, incomplete details, potential contradictions, context, constraints and the user's intended goal.
    - Explicitly generate {{number_of_versions}} distinct interpretations.
    - Clearly summarize each interpretation explicitly for context.

For each interpretation perform explicitly:
Step 2. Reasoning:
    - For each interpretation, explicitly reason about ambiguities, missing details, and optimization opportunities.
    - Summarize your explicit reasoning clearly for the action step.
Step 3. Action:
    - Take explicit actions based on your reasoning, explicitly involving external or public resources for clarification, verification, or enrichment.
    - Clearly document explicit actions.
    - Explicitly summarize your actions clearly for the observation step.
Step 4. Observation:
    - Explicitly document observations resulting from actions taken.
    - Clearly evaluate how actions impacted and improved the interpretation.
    - Explicitly summarize your observations clearly as context for iterative refinements.
Repeat Steps 2-4 iteratively if ambiguities remain unresolved, explicitly summarizing each cycle.
Step 5. Consistency Evaluation and Final Synthesis:
    - Evaluate explicitly each interpretation for consistency, reliability, and clarity based on all iterations.
    - Select explicitly the most consistent and reliable interpretation.
    - Clearly summarize your selection and explicitly state the final optimized query.

**Guidelines**:
	- Explicitly integrate external knowledge to enhance accuracy in each iteration.
	- Explicitly avoid hallucinations and error propagation by revisiting earlier reasoning, actions, or observations as needed.
    - Maintain explicit context and clearly summarize each step to facilitate adaptive, reflective reasoning.
