**Input**: {{user_query}}

**Instructions**:
Use the Reasoning+Action+Observation (ReAct) approach to optimize the input query explicitly over {{number_of_iterations}} iterations.
Each iteration explicitly involves reasoning about the query, take action based on this reasoning, observe the results and then use these observations to inform the next cycle of reasoning.
Clearly summarize each step, passing context explicitly forward between iterations.

**Dynamic Iterative Process**:
Step 1. Reasoning:
    - Carefully read and fully comprehend the user's query.
    - Identify ambiguities, incomplete details, potential contradictions, context, constraints and the user's intended goal.
    - Summarize your explicit reasoning clearly for the action step.
Step 2. Action:
    - Explicitly take actions based on your reasoning. Actions involve consulting external or public resources for clarification, verification, or enrichment.
    - Clearly document each explicit action taken.
    - Explicitly summarize your actions clearly for the observation step.
Step 3. Observation:
    - Explicitly document observations resulting from the actions taken.
    - Clearly evaluate how actions improved or impacted the query.
    - Explicitly summarize your observations clearly as context for the next iteration.
Step 4. Final Synthesis:
	- Explicitly integrate reasoning, actions, and observations from all cycles into a coherent, fully optimized query.
	- Explicitly confirm there are no contradictions or unresolved issues.
    - Clearly summarize explicitly the final optimized query.

**Guidelines**:
	• Each iteration explicitly integrates external knowledge to enhance accuracy.
	• Explicitly aim to avoid hallucinations and error propagation by revisiting earlier reasoning steps whenever needed.
    • Explicitly maintain clear context and integrate each step to facilitate an adaptive and reflective reasoning process.
