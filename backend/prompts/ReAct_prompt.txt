**Input**: {{user_query}}

**Instructions**:
Iteratively refine and optimize the original query using the ReAct technique over {{number_of_iterations}} iterations.
In each iteration, perform the following steps:

Step 1: Reasoning
    - Reflect on the query, considering constraints, context, and any relevant background knowledge.
    - Identify the next step or piece of information needed.
    - Keep the reasoning concise; if the iteration count is large, summarize significant changes from previous iterations rather than repeating extensive details.

Step 2: Acting
    - Rewrite the query based on your reasoning.
    - Simplify language, remove redundancies and ensure all critical elements are clear.
    - Make the query self-contained and precisely aligned with the intended task or outcome.

Step 3: Observation
    - Review the refined query to ensure it aligns with the initial objectives.
    - Verify that the updated query correctly implements the key insights from the reasoning step.
    - If needed, incorporate additional adjustments directly into the query (within the same iteration).
    - Be mindful of verbosity: highlight only major improvements in your observation rather than re-describing every minor detail.

**Output Format**:
    - Provide the result STRICTLY as JSON.
    - For each iteration (1 to {{number_of_iterations}}), produce an object with the following keys:
         {
           "Iteration": <iteration_number>,
           "Reasoning": "<Concise summary of analysis and key insights>",
           "Action": "<The rewritten query for that iteration>",
           "Observation": "<Brief evaluation of the changes made>"
         }
    - After the last iteration, present the **Optimized_Query** as a single JSON key-value pair.
