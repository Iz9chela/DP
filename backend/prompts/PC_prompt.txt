**Input**: {{user_query}}

**Instructions**:
Use the Prompt-Chaining approach to optimize the input query explicitly. Break down the query into smaller, manageable subtasks, clearly chaining the results from each subtask into the subsequent query.
Explicitly maintain context by summarizing the outcome after each step, passing this forward clearly to the next subtask.

Step 1. Task Decomposition:
    - Analyze comprehensively the user's query.
    - Explicitly break down the complex task into clearly defined, manageable subtasks.
    - Provide a brief and explicit summary of each identified subtask.

**Repeat the following steps for each identified subtask**
Step 2. Optimize Subtask:
   - Directly address the current subtask, focusing on accuracy and clarity.
   - Apply the following optimization rules:
       1. Include only essential details, removing redundancies.
       2. Preserve meaningful context for continuity.
       3. Refine wording to be succinct yet comprehensive.
   - Summarize the optimized result before proceeding.
Step 3. Context Integration:
    - Clearly integrate the current subtask’s refined output into the broader context.
    - Ensure continuity and explicitly reference prior outputs to maintain clarity and prevent redundancy.
    - Clearly document how each subtask’s result affects the subsequent step.
Step 4. Synthesize:
    - Explicitly combine all outputs from completed subtasks into a cohesive, complete, and optimized final query.
    - Clearly ensure there are no contradictions, omissions, or unresolved issues.
    - Explicitly summarize the final synthesis clearly confirming completeness and optimization.

**Guidelines**:
    - Each subtask must explicitly build upon the context provided by previous subtasks.
    - Maintain clear, step-by-step reasoning throughout.

**Output Format**:
    - Your response must STRICTLY adhere to the JSON format provided below. No additional explanations or text outside the JSON structure are permitted.
    - Provide a STRICTLY JSON example:
{
    "Query_Chaining_Process": [
        {
            "Subtask": "Description of Subtask 1",
            "Subtask_Result": "Result and summary of subtask 1"
        },
        {
            "Subtask": "Description of Subtask X",
            "Subtask_Result": "Result and summary of subtask X"
        }
    ],
    "Final_Optimized_Query": "<Final synthesized and optimized query>"
