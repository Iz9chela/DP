**Input**: {{user_query}}

**Instructions**:
Use the Prompt-Chaining approach to optimize the input query explicitly. Break down the query into smaller, manageable subtasks, clearly chaining the results from each subtask into the subsequent query.
Explicitly maintain context by summarizing the outcome after each step, passing this forward clearly to the next subtask.

Step 1. Task Decomposition:
    - Analyze comprehensively the user's query.
    - Explicitly break down the complex task into clearly defined, manageable subtasks.
    - Provide a brief and explicit summary of each identified subtask.

**Iterative Process** (Repeat for each subtask):
Step 2. Solve Subtask:
    - Explicitly address each subtask individually, focusing on clearly defined objectives.
    - Provide explicit reasoning and outcomes for the subtask.
    - Clearly summarize the output of each subtask as context for the next subtask.
Step 3. Context Integration:
    - Explicitly integrate outputs from previous subtasks into the next subtask.
    - Ensure continuity and explicitly reference prior outputs to maintain clarity and prevent redundancy.
    - Clearly document context integration for each iteration.
Step 4. Synthesize:
    - Explicitly combine all outputs from completed subtasks into a cohesive, complete, and optimized final query.
    - Clearly ensure there are no contradictions, omissions, or unresolved issues.
    - Explicitly summarize the final synthesis clearly confirming completeness and optimization.

**Guidelines**:
    - Each subtask must explicitly build upon the context provided by previous subtasks.
    - Clearly maintain continuity and clarity of reasoning throughout each iteration.
    - Allow slight expansions only if necessary to preserve critical context or information.

**Output Format**:
    - Your response must STRICTLY adhere to the JSON format provided below. No additional explanations or text outside the JSON structure are permitted.
    - Provide a STRICTLY JSON example:
